# Simplify Path Function

## Introduction

### Unix-style File System

A Unix-style file system is a hierarchical file system structure commonly used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. In this system, directories and files are organized in a tree structure, with the root directory `/` at the top. Each directory can contain files and subdirectories, which can themselves contain more files and subdirectories.

### Canonical Path

A canonical path is the simplest, most standardized form of a file path. It removes any ambiguities, such as redundant slashes, single periods (which refer to the current directory), and double periods (which refer to the parent directory). The canonical path ensures a unique representation of any given file or directory location in the file system.

## Approach

1. **Split the Path**:
   - Split the input path by slashes `/` to process each segment separately.

2. **Initialize a Stack**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of the directories in the canonical path.

3. **Process Each Segment**:
   - **Double Period (`..`)**: If the segment is `..`, pop the stack to move up one directory level (if the stack is not empty).
   - **Single Period (`.`) or Empty**: Ignore segments that are `.` or empty strings, as they represent the current directory or redundant slashes.
   - **Valid Directory Names**: Push valid directory names onto the stack.

4. **Construct the Canonical Path**:
   - Join the elements in the stack with slashes `/` to form the simplified path.
   - Ensure the path starts with a single slash `/`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the constructed canonical path.

## Code Snippet

```python
def simplifypath(path):
    """
    Simplify the given Unix-style file path to its canonical form.

    Parameters:
    path (str): The input absolute path in Unix-style file system.

    Returns:
    str: The simplified canonical path.
    """
    values = path.split("/")
    stack = []
    
    for value in values:
        if value == "..":
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
        elif value == "." or value == "":
            continue
        else:
            stack.append(value)
    
    return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```
# Complexities
## Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input path. This is because we process each character in the path once during the split and then process each segment once during the iteration.
# Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all components are valid directory names and stored in the stack.
## Explanation
Splitting the Path: The path is split into segments using split("/").
Processing Components:
.. means to go up one directory level, so we pop the stack if it's not empty.
. and empty strings are ignored.
Valid directory names are pushed onto the stack.
Constructing the Path: After processing all segments, the stack is joined with / to form the canonical path.
